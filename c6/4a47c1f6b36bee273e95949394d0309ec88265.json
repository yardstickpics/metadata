Colours indicate degree of the polynomial the number is a root of (red = linear, i.e. the rationals, green = quadratic, blue = cubic, yellow = quartic...).  Points becomes smaller as the integer polynomial coefficients become larger.  View shows integers 0,1 and 2 at bottom right, +<i>i</i> near top.\n</p>"
