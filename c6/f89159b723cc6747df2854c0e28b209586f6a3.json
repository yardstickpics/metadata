Membership of the mess is automatic for all Junior Non-Commissioned Officers, and Potential NCO's of the PNCO Cadre have honourary membership. Junior NCOs (JNCO) pay mess dues each year, and the Mess occasionally holds functions in and out of Camp. The head of the mess is actually the <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimental_Sergeant_Major\" title=\"Regimental Sergeant Major\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Regimental Sergeant Major</a>. Although the Warrant Officers and Senior NCOs have their own mess, as do the commissioned officers, there is only a handful of each in a rifle company and the corporal's mess, with its larger membership tends to be the centre of attention after a drill night as officers and SNCOs join the JNCOs there. Visible in this photograph, taken after a drill night, are numbers of JNCO's, a <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Staff_Instructor\" title=\"Permanent Staff Instructor\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Permanent Staff Instructor</a> (in khaki shirt), and several SNCO's, including the Duty Sergeant (with red sash).\n</p>\n<p>Uploaded by author <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aodhdubh\" title=\"User:Aodhdubh\">Aodhdubh</a> 02:27, 14 November 2006 (UTC)\n</p>"
