The \"Réunion Solitaire\" (Raphus solitarius) was classified as a relative of the Dodo.That bird was at various times classified as Victoriornis imperialis (the \"Réunion Solitaire\" or \"White Dodo\" of descriptions and paintings - the latter obviously show an albino dodo from Mauritius) and Borbonibis latipes (from the first ibis bones found, before a connection to the solitaire reports had been made). In fact it was the Réunion Sacred Ibis or Réunion Flightless Ibis (Threskiornis solitarius), an extinct bird species that was native to the island of Réunion.\n</p>"
