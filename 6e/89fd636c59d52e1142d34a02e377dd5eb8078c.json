  "html": "<p>Battleships of the Second Squadron, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, saluting during their visit to Amoy, China, circa 30 October - 5 November 1908.\nThe U.S. Ships are anchored in line of Divisions, with the Third Division closest to the camera. Louisiana (BB-19), flagship of the Second Squadron and Third Division, is partially visible at the far right. Astern of her in the same line are Virginia (BB-13) (right center) and Missouri (BB-11) (left center).\nThe Fourth Division is anchored just beyond the Third Division's line. Wisconsin (BB-9), Fourth Division flagship, is toward the right [between Virginia and Louisiana]. Astern of her (in no particular order) are Kearsarge (BB-5) and Kentucky (BB-6).\nThe four grey ships, in the most distant line, all appear to be Chinese cruisers.\n</p>"
