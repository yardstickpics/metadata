  "text": "Artist's impression of the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) in its enclosure on Cerro Armazones, a 3060-metre mountaintop in Chile's Atacama Desert. The 40-metre-class E-ELT will be the largest optical/infrared telescope in the world — the world's biggest eye on the sky. Operations are planned to start early in the next decade, and the E-ELT will tackle some of the biggest scientific challenges of our time.\r\n\r\nThe design for the E-ELT shown here was published in 2011 and is preliminary.\r\n\r\nCredit:\r\nESO/L.
