  "html": "<p><b>English:</b>  Extinctbirds1907 P25A, The image shows a hypothetical drawing based on Pezophaps solitaria from description of the Sieur D.B. (Dubois), 1674. Apart from the colours, the overall morphology is identical to Frohawk's other restoration of Pezophaps solitaria. The Réunion Sacred Ibis or Réunion Flightless Ibis (see below) (Threskiornis solitarius), is an extinct bird species that was native to the island of Réunion. It is probably the same bird discovered by Portuguese sailors there in 1613 and until recently assumed by biologists to be a member of the solitaire family and called the \"Réunion Solitaire\" (Raphus solitarius), classified as a relative of the Dodo.\n</p>"
