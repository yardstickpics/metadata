South Pass is a gradual elevation, gently rolling and table-like, and one can pass the line of separation between <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Ocean_Pass\" title=\"Two Ocean Pass\">the waters of the two oceans</a> without observing it. In 1867 gold was discovered in richly paying quantities, and caused a great \"stampede\" or flocking together of all the wandering miners from over the whole country. Under this influx of population these two \"cities\" South Pass City and <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_City,_Wyoming\" title=\"Atlantic City, Wyoming\">Atlantic City</a> sprang up and were for a time lively, bustling towns. The gold is found both in <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placer_deposit\" title=\"Placer deposit\">quartz and placers</a>, and is still mined with good profit. South Pass City has an elevation above the sea of 7,857 feet, and Atlantic City 7,665 feet. <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_County,_Wyoming\" title=\"Fremont County, Wyoming\">Fremont County, Wyoming</a>. 1870.\n</p>"
