  "html": "<p>Drawing of a bronze tablet found at Pergamon. It depicts three crowned goddesses labeled as ΔΙΟΝΗ (Dione), ΦΟΙΒΙΗ (Phoibie or Phoebe), and ΝΥΧΙΗ (Nychie), each surrounded by dense inscriptions, mostly untranslatable syllables for incantation <i>(voces magicae)</i>. The inscription around Phoebe invokes Persephone, Melinoë, and Leucophryne. The lettering dates the inscription to the first half of the 3rd century AD. Esoteric symbols are inscribed along the edges. The center hole suggests that the tablet was suspended over a surface and used for divination.\n</p>"
