The 3d profile has been measured with a confocal white light microscope. The lateral range of the measurement is 800 µm by 800 µm (0.8 mm by 0.8 mm), the vertical range is approximately 60 µm (0.06 mm). The colours of the surface show the height according to the scale on the right side of the image. The graphics was created using MATLAB.\r\n\r\nConfocal_measurement_of_1-euro-star_3d.png: Dr. Schorsch\r\nEUR_1_(2007_issue).png: Ssolbergj\r\nderivative work: Dr. Schorsch https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Xorx"
