  "html": "<p><b>English:</b> Â Plate 24 from Rothschild's <i>Extinct birds</i> (1907). The <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo\" title=\"Dodo\">dodo</a> (<i>Raphus cucullatus</i>) was a flightless bird endemic to the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. This was based on the picture by Roelandt Savery in Berlin, but the wings, tail and bill have been based partly oon Pierre Witthoos' picture of the white Dodo, and partly from anatomical examination. The tail appears to have been curled over the back in life, according to most authors, so this image is partially inaccurate. In life, the nostrils were also vertical slits, rather than horizontal.\n</p>"
