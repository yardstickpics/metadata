Cleveland, discusses the emotional state of the depicted woman: \"The sobbing woman with arm outstretched in Nazi salute has been consistently interpreted as a symbol of forced obedience to the German conquerors of Czechoslovakia ... The picture was snapped by a German press photographer and first appeared in the National Socialist newspaper, Völkischer Beobachter, in the fall of 1938, shortly after the Sudeten 'Anschluss.' The Nazi explanation was that here were portrayed the intense emotions of joy which swept the Sudeten Germans as Hitler crossed the Czech border at Asch and drove through the streets of the nearby ancient city of Eger [the German name for <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheb\" title=\"Cheb\">Cheb</a>], 99% of whose inhabitants were ardently pro-Nazi Sudeten Germans at the time.\"\n</p>"
