  "text": "Get out your red/blue glasses and check out this close-up of spacesuited NASA astronaut John Olivas outside the International Space Station. Carefully constructed from two photographs taken during space shuttle orbiter Discovery's last visit to the orbiting outpost, the 3D anaglyph creates the compelling illusion that you can actually reach out and take his gloved hand. The photographer, fellow spacewalker ESA astronaut Christer Fuglesang, along with ISS structures and planet Earth's horizon, are reflected in Olivas' helmet visor.\r\nDate\t\r\nSource\tNASA Astronomy Picture of the Day\r\nAuthor\tPatrick Vantuyne"
