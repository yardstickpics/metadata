  "html": "<p>The poster includes four large columns and 16 colors. Large columns are separated by thick white lines. The first left large column contains: 1) <span style=\"background-color: #D97BB1; color:;\">photosystem ΙΙ inhibitors</span>, 2) <span style=\"background-color: #C9543F; color:;\">photosystem Ι inhibitors</span> , 3) <span style=\"background-color: #A0C8EA; color:;\">PPG oxidase or protox inhibitors</span>, and 4) <span style=\"background-color: #1D56A5; color:white;\">carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitors</span>; the second left large column contains: 1) <span style=\"background-color: #EB2126; color:;\">ALS or AHAS inhibitors</span>, 2) <span style=\"background-color: #F05354; color:;\">EPSP synthase inhibitors</span>, 3) <span style=\"background-color: #CFE295; color:;\">glutamine synthetase inhibitors</span>, and 4) <span style=\"background-color: #C0BEBE; color:;\">unknown</span>; the third left large column contains: 1) <span style=\"background-color: #C9CA2C; color:;\">mitosis inhibitors</span>, 2) <span style=\"background-color: #B098C7; color:;\">fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis inhibitors</span>, 3) <span style=\"background-color: #DF6826; color:;\">ACCase inhibitors</span>, 4) <span style=\"background-color: #ECB4D2; color:;\">dihydropteroate synthetase inhibitors</span>, and 5) <span style=\"background-color: #F5EA08; color:;\">oxidative phosphorylation uncouplers</span>; and the fourth left large column contains: 1) <span style=\"background-color: #C9CA2C; color:;\">mitosis inhibitors</span>, 2) <span style=\"background-color: #068040; color:white;\">cellulose inhibitors</span>, 3) <span style=\"background-color: #66431E; color:white;\">synthetic auxins</span>, and 4) <span style=\"background-color: #C7972B; color:;\">auxin transport inhibitors</span>. The large columns and colors are made to simplify the herbicide classification. For example, the first left large column and the upper three colors of the second and third left large columns are affected by the processes of photosynthesis, amino acid and fatty acid biosynthesis, respectively. Active ingredients of the herbicides based on their chemical structure have been classified within chemical families. Herbicide groups on the upper left and right side of the chemical family are specified by the HRAC and WSSA groups and their active ingredients have been placed under the structure of the chemical family, thus each cell contains the name and structure of chemical family, herbicide group, and active ingredient. Each cell is separated by thin white lines from the other cells on the image. Overall, the poster includes 430 herbicides which have been classified by 16 mechanisms of action and 119 chemical families. 23 HRAC groups and 28 WSSA groups have been designated for the herbicides.\n</p>"
