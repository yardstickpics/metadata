Bendigo had many admirers, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who wrote: \"You didn't know of Bendigo? / Well that knocks me out! / Who's your board school teacher? / What's he been about? / Chock a block with fairy tales; / Full of useless cram, / And never heard of Bendigo / The Pride Of Nottingham.\"\n</p>"
